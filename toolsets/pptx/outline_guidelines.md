# PPTX Outline Guidelines

1. **Clarify the objective**: Start every outline by restating the problem, audience, and success criteria.
2. **Decide on structure**: Choose between chronological, problem-solution, or comparative framing based on the topic.
3. **Balance breadth and depth**:
   - Use 5–7 slides unless the user requests otherwise.
   - Each slide should highlight one core idea with 2–4 concise bullet points.
4. **Support with evidence**: Encourage inclusion of metrics, case studies, or quotes where relevant.
5. **End with action**: Reserve the final slide for summary plus next steps, recommendations, or questions.
6. **Tone and branding**: If the user mentions style or brand cues, reflect them in slide titles and phrasing.
